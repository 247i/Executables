  END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

  This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement 
  between the end user and the SOFTWARE author Dmitry Sidorov. 
  By using the SOFTWARE you agree to all terms of the EULA.

  1. GRANT OF LICENSE

  1.0. EDITION, LICENSE COPIES, AND RIGHTS

  The scope of granted rights depends on the EDITION (license type), 
  number of supported OS families, and the number of LICENSE COPIES. 
  In the "About" box (SOFTWARE "Help" menu) you can view the EDITION, 
  number of COPIES and license expiration date. If the number of COPIES 
  is not specified, you are granted one (1) license. If no expiration 
  date is specified, then there is no time limit.

  1.1. FREE EDITION

  For FREE EDITION only the paragraphs 1.1, 5, and 6 are applied.

  You may use the FREE EDITION for non-commercial purposes, including 
  charitable organizations, for educational purposes in educational 
  institutions, and for evaluation. In the FREE EDITION, you can 
  recover up to 4000 files per request from the file panel (from the 
  selected directory without processing nested directories).

  You may reproduce and distribute FREE EDITION copies only under the 
  following set of conditions: the SOFTWARE is obtained directly from 
  the SOFTWARE author or from the SOFTWARE websites; keys and other 
  components of other EDITIONS are not transferred; the composition 
  and components of the SOFTWARE are not modified (except for 
  reversible transcoding); the SOFTWARE origin, authorship, terms of 
  this EULA are available to the end user explicitly. FREE EDITION 
  copies may be included in free and paid packages.

  1.2.1. EDITIONS "EXPRESS" AND "PERSONAL": PERSONAL USE ONLY

  With EDITIONS "EXPRESS" and "PERSONAL", you may use the SOFTWARE for 
  personal non-commercial purposes only. The usage in organizations and 
  any direct or indirect benefit are prohibited.

  1.2.2. "STANDARD" EDITION: USE FOR OWN NEEDS ONLY

  With the "STANDARD" EDITION, you may use the SOFTWARE as a person or 
  organization for own needs only. Organizations, employees or other 
  persons providing data recovery services may not use the SOFTWARE.

  1.2.3. "PROFESSIONAL" EDITION: COMMERCIAL USE AND PAID SERVICES

  With the "PROFESSIONAL" EDITION, you may use the functionality of the 
  SOFTWARE for both non-commercial and commercial purposes and provide 
  data recovery services.

  1.3. RIGHTS TO RUN AND STORE SOFTWARE COPIES

  You may RUN as many SOFTWARE COPIES (have as many unfinished 
  processes) as the number of LICENSE COPIES you are granted.

  Including backups, you may create and store two (2) more copies of 
  the SOFTWARE than the number of LICENSE COPIES. For storage purposes, 
  a single copy may include multiple different versions of the SOFTWARE 
  in a single data store.

  2. ACTIVATION

  Activation unlocks the full functionality of the SOFTWARE. During 
  activation, a non-unique code identifying the hardware or portable 
  device is sent to the SOFTWARE activation sites to obtain an 
  activation code.

  With a license for one OS family ("1-OS"), you can only activate 
  SOFTWARE versions designed for the same OS family that was chosen 
  during the first activation. The "Multi-OS" license allows you to 
  activate SOFTWARE versions for different OS families.

  If the license expires, you may continue to RUN the SOFTWARE on the 
  same environment in which it was activated, but neither support, nor 
  reactivation, nor functionality guarantees will be granted anymore.

  2.1. STATIONARY ACTIVATION binds the RUN of a SOFTWARE COPY to 
  a specific computer hardware configuration.

  Activation may be declined if you change more than three (3) 
  associated hardware configurations per year per LICENSE COPY. The CPU 
  or motherboard change, the use of additional virtualization imply the 
  change of hardware. This does not count other environment changes 
  that may also require reactivation of the SOFTWARE.

  2.2. PORTABLE ACTIVATION (granted only for "PROFESSIONAL" EDITION) 
  binds the RUN of a SOFTWARE COPY to the connected portable device.

  It is designed to RUN a SOFTWARE COPY on different computers by 
  connecting the associated portable device. Activation may be declined 
  if you bind a LICENSE COPY to more than three (3) devices per year.

  2.3. ONE-TIME ACTIVATION (granted only for "PROFESSIONAL" EDITION), 
  using one-time passwords, allows you to additionally RUN a SOFTWARE 
  COPY up to five (5) times a month on different computers.

  3. SOFTWARE UPDATES

  If support for a SOFTWARE version ends, you may use the next 
  available version, and the new agreement supersedes the previous one 
  only in clauses that clarify the terms and expand your rights. In 
  other cases, updates may only be used under the terms of the new 
  license agreement.

  You may use previous available SOFTWARE versions under the terms of 
  this EULA too. However, the identification of the hardware may be 
  different and will entail additional restrictions on the number of 
  hardware changes in accordance with paragraph 2.

  4. SOFTWARE UPGRADES

  Upgrade is a change of a complete set, the number of license copies, 
  or the EDITION. To apply the SOFTWARE upgrade, you must first have a 
  license that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon the upgrade, the new 
  agreement supersedes the previous one, and you may no longer use keys 
  and other components provided under the previous license.

  5. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS

  You may not use the SOFTWARE otherwise than expressly provided by 
  law, this EULA, and additional agreements with the SOFTWARE author.

  This EULA does not grant you rights to create derivative work, to 
  reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise study the 
  SOFTWARE code, nor to sell, rent, lease or sublicense the SOFTWARE.

  6. LIMITED WARRANTY

  THE AUTHOR OF THE SOFTWARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY FOR 
  THE SOFTWARE. THE SOFTWARE AND ANY RELATED DOCUMENTATION IS 
  PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES 
  OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR 
  NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF USE OR 
  PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE REMAINS WITH YOU. IN NO EVENT SHALL 
  THE AUTHOR OF THE SOFTWARE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER 
  ARISING OUT OF USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING 
  BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DATA LOSS OR DISTORTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS 
  PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, 
  PERSONAL INJURY, LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER PECUNIARY OR OTHER 
  LOSS WHATSOEVER), EVEN IF THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
